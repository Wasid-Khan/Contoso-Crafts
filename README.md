Created dynamic websites with ASP.NET, using C#, Razor pages, dependency injection, product ratings, Blazor integration, and publish to Azure.

This project is a dynamic web application built using ASP.NET Core with Razor Pages. I've implemented key features like data handling through dependency injection, a product catalog with real-time ratings, and JSON API integration to make the data accessible for mobile apps. The app is styled using Bootstrap for a clean and responsive UI, and I've integrated Blazor components for enhanced interactivity.
